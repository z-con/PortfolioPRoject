                <h4>Drizly - Integrations Engineer</h4>
                <p>As an Engineer on the Integrations team my primary role was to extract data from a myriad of cloud
                    and
                    on-site point-of-sale systems and parse that data for use in our core application. The information
                    extracted
                    from these systems was used to inform the Drizly app of current inventory levels and sales metrics
                    in a
                    given partner store.</p>

                    departments

                    our
