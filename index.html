                <h4>School of Motion - Product Manager</h4>
                <p>At School of Motion I've managed two very large UI overhaul projects, whilst also leading the
                    transition
                    of our development team from 100% third-party to 100% in-house. I'm taking a 9-week leave to attend
                    the IronHack intensive and will return as the 4th full-time full-stack engineer on our team.

                <h4>Drizly - Integrations Engineer</h4>
                <p>As an Engineer on the Integrations team my primary role was to extract data from a myriad of cloud
                    and
                    on-site point-of-sale systems and parse that data for use in our core application. The information
                    extracted
                    from these systems was used to inform the Drizly app of current inventory levels and sales metrics
                    in a
                    given partner store.</p>

                <h4>Teespring - QA Automation</h4>
                <p>Fulfilling dual roles on opposite sides of the same development coin Â­- I maintained a close
                    relationship
                    with stakeholders in each department of the organization and acted as liaison between those
                    departments
                    and
                    our
                    engineering team. In addition to this I saw to it that the resulting pull requests make it past the
                    finish
                    line without any headaches.</p>
