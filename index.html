                    The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores,

                    We know
                    you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf.
                    Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. You're going to be an interesting
                    companion, Mr. Data. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data?<br><br>

                    Damage report! I'll alert the crew. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the
                    history of Starfleet. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship.<br><br>

                <p>At School of Motion I've managed two very large UI overhaul projects, whilst also leading the
                    transition
                    of our development team from 100% third-party to 100% in-house. I'm taking a 9-week leave to attend
                    the IronHack intensive and will return as the 4th full-time full-stack engineer on our team.

                <h4>Drizly - Integrations Engineer</h4>
                <p>As an Engineer on the Integrations team my primary role was to extract data from a myriad of cloud
                    and
                    on-site point-of-sale systems and parse that data for use in our core application. The information
                    extracted
                    from these systems was used to inform the Drizly app of current inventory levels and sales metrics
                    in a
                    given partner store.</p>

                    with stakeholders in each department of the organization and acted as liaison between those
                    departments

                    our
